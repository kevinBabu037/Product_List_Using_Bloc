The app features a product list screen that displays items in a visually appealing grid layout with images, names, and prices. Users can tap on any product to view its details, which include a larger image, description, price, and an add-to-cart button. The app fetches product data from a RESTful API and manages state efficiently using the BLoC pattern. This ensures that the app remains responsive and the user interface stays updated with the latest data.
